                Life is a journey, not a race. <br /><br />
                Though I am behind the flow of the course, but I'll never quit from the journey. Because it's a journey of learning and I enjoy it too much. <br />
                If you learn with struggle in adverse situation for your surroundings,
                though it's slow but steady, then no one can stop your learning. <br /> Keep learning and never quit from the journey of learning.
